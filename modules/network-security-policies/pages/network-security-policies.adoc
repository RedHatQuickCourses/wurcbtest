#  Network Security Policies

Network Security Policies in Azure Red Hat OpenShift (ARO) control network traffic flow within the cluster.

*   **Ingress Network Policies**::
    *   Supported by OpenShift SDN, enabled by default, and enforced by users.
    *   V1 NetworkPolicy compliant, offering granular control down to the pod level using `NetworkPolicy` objects.
    *   Can include ingress control via IP allow lists using route annotations.
    *   All cluster ingress traffic traverses the defined load balancer.
*   **Egress Network Policies**::
    *   Supported by the OpenShift egress firewall feature using `EgressNetworkPolicy` objects.
    *   Used to prevent or limit outbound traffic from pods.
    *   Limited to one policy per namespace/project and not supported on the `default` namespace.
    *   Policies are evaluated in order (first to last).
